# Mapping-memory-Party-for-PhD-students
Friendship is critical for a meaningful scholarship, and partying is one of the most straightforward methods to build new friendships. We are creating a map for MSU Ph.D. students looking to find a place where friendship can grow with the help of good conversations, or beers, or dancing, or all of those things at the same time.
